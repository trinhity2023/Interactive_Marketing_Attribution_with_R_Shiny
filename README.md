<h1 align="center"> Interactive Marketing Attribution with R Shiny </h1>

This R project leverages R Shiny to provide Starbucks with a comprehensive marketing attribution tool.

It offers insights into important metrics from the first project as such as response rates, offer ranking, and customer demographics. 

Additionally, the dashboard provides new insights into low engagement users, offer effectiveness, and potential store locations to inform marketing strategy.
