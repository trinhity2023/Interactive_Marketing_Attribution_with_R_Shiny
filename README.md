<h1 align="center"> Interactive Marketing Attribution with R Shiny </h1>

This R project leverages R Shiny and ChatGPT to provide Starbucks with a comprehensive marketing attribution tool.

It offers insights into important metrics from the first project as such as marketing offer ranking, cohort analysis & user tenure/growth, and response rates. 

Additionally, the dashboard provides new insights into low engagement users, time distribution between offer sent and transaction, and a potential store location to inform marketing strategy and business growth.
